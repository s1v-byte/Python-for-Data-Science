Perfect — so you want the same capability-style goals, but Python only, no SQL / BI / Excel.
Below is a clean, professional Python-only capability list tailored for an entry-level data analyst aiming for Manila roles, written exactly like:
Writing API-to-DataFrame pipelines in Python
You can treat this as:
•	your learning roadmap
•	your personal project goals
•	future resume bullet phrasing
________________________________________
Python Data Acquisition & Ingestion
•	Writing API-to-DataFrame pipelines in Python
•	Consuming REST APIs using requests
•	Handling authentication, pagination, and rate limits
•	Parsing nested JSON responses into tabular structures
•	Ingesting data from CSV, Excel, and web-based sources
•	Validating schemas and enforcing data type consistency
________________________________________
Python Data Cleaning & Preparation
•	Cleaning datasets using pandas (nulls, duplicates, outliers)
•	Standardizing dates, currencies, and categorical values
•	Converting raw data into analysis-ready DataFrames
•	Applying vectorized operations for performance
•	Creating reusable data cleaning functions
________________________________________
Data Transformation & Feature Engineering (Python)
•	Performing grouped aggregations and joins in pandas
•	Creating derived metrics and KPIs
•	Building fact and dimension-style DataFrames
•	Implementing time-based features (MoM, YoY, rolling averages)
•	Reshaping data using melt, pivot, and explode
________________________________________
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Conducting statistical summaries and distribution analysis
•	Identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies
•	Performing segmentation and cohort-style analysis
•	Comparing groups using descriptive statistics
•	Documenting analytical assumptions and findings
________________________________________
Data Visualization in Python
•	Creating business-ready charts using matplotlib and seaborn
•	Designing clear, labeled, and interpretable visuals
•	Visualizing time series, category comparisons, and distributions
•	Highlighting insights with annotations and color logic
•	Exporting visuals for reports and presentations
________________________________________
Automation & Workflow Development
•	Writing end-to-end analysis scripts in Python
•	Automating recurring data refresh and reporting workflows
•	Implementing basic logging and error handling
•	Structuring projects into modular, reusable files
•	Running scripts via command line or schedulers
________________________________________
Code Quality & Professional Practices
•	Writing readable, well-documented Python code
•	Using virtual environments and dependency management
•	Version-controlling projects with Git
•	Creating clear README documentation
•	Following PEP 8 style guidelines
________________________________________
Python-Only “Best Candidate” Bonus Skills
•	Working efficiently with large datasets (100k–1M rows)
•	Using NumPy for performance-critical operations
•	Applying basic statistical tests (mean comparison, correlation)
•	Implementing simple forecasting or trend projection models
•	Exporting processed data for downstream tools
________________________________________
One-Sentence “Best Candidate” Python Pitch
You should eventually be able to say:
“I can build Python pipelines that pull data from APIs, clean and transform it into analysis-ready DataFrames, perform exploratory analysis, and automate repeatable reporting workflows.”
That sentence alone is strong for entry-level Manila analyst roles.
